# Made Possible by Ariba Khan and Aimee Liang


We wanted to create an application that could bring your finances to one spot: you could connect your bank information, view and purchase stocks, and manage your personal
financial goals.

We used an API to incorporate the stock information, and seeded our information for our Module presentation.

Stretch goals for a Version 2.0 include creating a Financial Advisor capability that would be determined based on what your goals were, a join table to connect a User to a Financial Advisor, utilizing sessions and the Devise gem, methods that would change our frontend to update our Account Balance and reflect if their bank balance was sufficient to buy stocks(s), use an API to seed dummy data for a bank balance, and creating a clean minimalist CSS appearance.
